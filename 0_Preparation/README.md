# Preparing for the SDSC Summer Institute 2023

You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you prepare prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before we start, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

This section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions for setting up your account, connecting to Expanse and configuring your laptop to run the visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks.

* If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).  
* For basic GitHub usage on SDSC systems, see [here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/using_github)

### Slack:  <a name="slack"></a>
* We will also be using Slack as our main platform for announcements, where participants can communicate and ask for help. Download ([Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [MacOS](https://slack.com/downloads/mac), or [Linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)) and [get started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users). 

You will be automatically added to the following channels once you've joined the Slack workspace (see prep email recevied): 
* #main: used for announcements, team-wide conversations, and any questions during sessions along with troubleshooting any issues related to account access or login 
* #breakout: used for instructions occurring in the Synthesis Center during parallel sessions. 
* #random: for anything else not related to the workshop (i.e., planning a meet-up) 

### Zoom:  <a name="zoom"></a>
